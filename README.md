# CartPole

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium.

## Features:
- Uses TensorFlow 2.x for building and training the neural network
- Implements a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning
- Solves the CartPole-v1 environment
- Includes visualization of training progress and final performance

## Contents:
- Environment setup and exploration
- Custom neural network model definition
- Policy gradient training loop
- Performance evaluation and visualization

This project demonstrates the application of deep reinforcement learning techniques to the classic CartPole control problem, providing a starting point for further exploration of RL algorithms.

## Requirements:
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Gymnasium
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
